This blog is about building applications that use Kusto. 

Kusto, the magic behind the Azure Data Explorer (ADE) service, is an
exceptionally powerful columnar store that can ingest and query Petabytes of
data in seconds. The engine is well described and documented (e.g. [Ziv&#39;s Kusto 101
blog](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-data-explorer-technology-101/){:target="_blank"},
[Uri&#39;s
introduction](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-azure-data-explorer/){:target="_blank"}, [Evgeney&#39;s white paper](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/azure-data-explorer/){:target="_blank"} and the
[ADE documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/)){:target="_blank"}. It
also has an emerging [Technical
Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Data-Explorer/bd-p/Kusto){:target="_blank"}
and an excellent blog written by [Yoni
Leibowitz](https://yonileibowitz.github.io/kusto.blog/){:target="_blank"}.

However, when we started writing applications interacting with Kusto we had to
pull many pieces of information and knowhow from multiple places to get end-to-end
solutions. While doing that we created assets that we think are worth sharing
with the Kusto developers community, and hence this blog.

The posts in this blog are in a sequence so they build on each
other. They have short descriptions on the home page that tell you what each is about, so you may 
decide to skip some or give them a cursory read.

The blog pages are generated by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"}, and the blog design reuses a [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} theme called [Simple](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/jekyll-simple){:target="_blank"}.
